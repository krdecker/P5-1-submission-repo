#Interactive Neighbourhood Map

The map shows a list of spots to eat in and around the Commercial-Broadway Station in East Vancouver, British Columbia. By making a selection you can see the Foursquare rating for the location and get exact address & phone number.

This is Project 5-1 of the **Udacity Front-End Developer Nano-Degree.**
It grows out of course-work from the _JavaScript Design Patterns_ course
& _Introduction to Ajax_ course.


##See It Work:

to see the working model:

##Usage:
 - Each spot on the list is represented by a marker on the map. One may click on a name in the list to see the marker bob to indicate the location and see a small street view.
 - If one clicks on the street view, another slide will open with detailed information about the spot, from FourSquare, and their colour-coded rating.
 - At the bottom of the screen, is a text input slot marked "FILTER" which one can activate and, by typing, reduce the list.
 - When only one spot remains from the list, pressing the 'enter' key will open the small street-view window and another 'enter' will open the info/rating slide.
 - Clicking on the slide will close it. Clicking on another name or marker will close both street-view and info-slide.
 - Return to the list of spots at any time by clicking the menu icon.
